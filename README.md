# üî•*Minecraft, but* it's absolute chaos
**Minecraft, but it's absolute chaos** is the ultimate "Minecraft, but" data pack. With over 50 gameplay modifiers and a centralized, convenient GUI to toggle and customize every aspect of the modifiers, you will enjoy all the chaos you could ever need!

## ü§î Why?
Browsing through [PlanetMinecraft's data pack page](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-packs/), you will quickly notice the sheer amount of *Minecraft, but* data packs flood it. You might think all these concepts sound fun. After playing with one, you might think to use several. What if you used 5, 10, 15, 20 different *Minecraft, but* data packs? You'll quickly find yourself annoyed with having to *manually* type out `/datapack disable "file/..."`. You will also consider it annoying that very few of them are customizable! For the data packs that *are* customizable, you will often forget *how* you were supposed to customize them in the first place! Managing several of these data packs quickly turns into more of a chore than it's worth.

**Minecraft, but it's absolute chaos** aims to solve this problem by making one centralized way to manage all your gameplay modifiers. Gone are the days of typing `/datapack`! Gone are the days of having to revisit that PlanetMinecraft page again and again to remind yourself how to configure it! Gone are the days of having to find that inconveniently placed `.txt` file hidden away in the archived data pack file! Gone are the days of a chat flooded by 50 different *Minecraft, but* data packs *every time* you reload.
